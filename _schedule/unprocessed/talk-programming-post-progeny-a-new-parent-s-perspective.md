When my daughter appeared on the scene in October 2016, my life was turned upside down. 

As I was returning to work, I found that previous strategies for managing my time weren't up to snuff and I needed to create new ones if I was to be effective at my craft. No longer did I have 15 minutes to "get in the zone" - I needed to get things done in any time available.  I learned to carve milestones out of minutes (sometimes) and will share what did (and didn't) work for me.

I also share stories about my general journey of becoming a parent that may be helpful to anyone thinking about becoming a parent (or just wondering what it might be like!).

Or you could just come to the talk for the cute baby pictures - they make everyone smile!
