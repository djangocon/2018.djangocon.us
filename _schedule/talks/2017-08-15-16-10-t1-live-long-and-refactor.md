abstract: Refactoring is never easy - especially when what you are refactoring will
  affect every single user of your production application. In this talk, I'll discuss
  how to tackle major refactors like an authentication system and avoid rebuilding
  your entire application in the process.

Refactoring major components of a live application with many users can be daunting. The stakes are even higher when the users are paying for your product. This talk covers how to approach building and incrementally deploying a complex refactor. Using a case study, I will walk through what makes major refactors so challenging, what you should avoid, and what can make them easier in the future.
