Django looks like it's doing just fine: it's a popular framework in a popular
language. We have major releases every six months. We have Django Girls, a
Foundation (and Fellows), super conferences in glamorous locations, and more.

But the code is old, there are 1300+ accepted open issues. There's only the
smallest number of people that regularly contribute code.

It's fine now. But it won't be. Your web framework needs you!

Contributing to open source is great, and it's great for you. Historically
we've not been that good at encouraging new and diverse contributors. We're
trying to change that, and we want to invite you to come and join-in.

I'm going to tell you quickly how to get involved, how to get support in that,
and how to let us know if that's failing.

You are qualified to contribute. More than that, your contribution is the
future of Django. Come code.
