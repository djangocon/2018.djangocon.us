          <p>The conference venue is equipped with doors that may or may not operate via handles. Surely you've used a door before?</p>

        <div class="faq-item-answer">
          <p>You seem to be struggling. There's a pretty good chance that once you get into the conference you will discover a multitude of conference-focused activities, which may or may not include:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Meeting people</li>
            <li>Attending talks, tutorials, or workshops</li>
            <li>Visiting booths setup by our sponsors. Please don't be weird about it.</li>
          </ul>

          <p>You can always leave the conference if it's not your thing. If you need help operating the door, please find an adult.</p>

          <p>Wait... Are you in a bathroom? Do you think.. do you think someone using the toilet is the speaker?</p>
