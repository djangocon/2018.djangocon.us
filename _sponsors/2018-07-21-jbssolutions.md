      JBS Solutions has developed custom web applications
      for clients from small to large, supporting e-commerce, 
      appointment scheduling, advertising, nationally televised events, 
      data warehousing/business intelligence and many others. 
      They work primarily in Django, but other technologies occasionally
      fit applications better (even Microsoft - a separate team is a
      Gold Application Development partner.)
