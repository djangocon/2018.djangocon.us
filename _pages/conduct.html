        <h2>Full Code of Conduct</h2>

        <p><em>To make clear what is expected, all delegates/attendees, speakers, exhibitors, organizers and volunteers at any DjangoCon US event are required to conform to the following Code of Conduct. Organizers will enforce this code throughout the event.</em></p>

        <h3>What the conference is</h3>

        <p>DjangoCon US is a community conference intended for networking and collaboration in the developer community.</p>

        <p>We value the participation of each member of the Django community and want all attendees to have an enjoyable and fulfilling experience. Accordingly, all attendees are expected to show respect and courtesy to other attendees throughout the conference, at all conference events, and in all conference online spaces (such as Slack), whether officially sponsored by DjangoCon US or not.</p>

        <h3>Be Kind To Others</h3>

        <p>Do not insult or put down other attendees. Behave professionally. Remember that harassment and sexist, racist, or exclusionary jokes are not appropriate for DjangoCon US. Attendees violating these rules may be asked to leave the conference without a refund at the sole discretion of the conference organizers.</p>

        <h3>Be Respectful</h3>

        <p>Not all of us will agree all the time, but disagreement is no excuse for poor behavior and poor manners. We do not tolerate harassment of conference participants in any form.</p>

        <p>Harassment includes: offensive verbal comments related to gender, gender identity, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, religion; sexual images in public spaces; deliberate intimidation, stalking, or following; harassing photography or recording; sustained disruption of talks or other events; inappropriate physical contact; and unwelcome sexual attention.</p>

        <h2>Choose Your Words</h2>

        <p>Be careful in the words that you choose. Remember that sexist, racist, and other exclusionary jokes can be offensive to those around you. Excessive swearing and offensive jokes are not appropriate for DjangoCon US. We are all adults, capable of having adult conversations. Preface your presentation with appropriate Trigger/Content Warnings, if necessary.</p>

        <p>All communication should be appropriate for a professional audience including people of many different backgrounds. Sexual language and imagery is not appropriate for any conference venue, including talks.</p>

        <p>Participants asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply immediately.</p>

        <p>Exhibitors in the expo hall, sponsor or vendor booths, or similar activities are also subject to the anti-harassment policy. In particular, exhibitors should not use sexualized images, activities, or other material. Booth staff (including volunteers) should not use sexualized clothing/uniforms/costumes, or otherwise create a sexualized environment.</p>


        <h2>Photography</h2>

        <p>In order to make DjangoCon US 2018 a great experience for everyone, do not photograph, video, or audio record anyone at DjangoCon without their express permission, sought in advance. If someone does not want to be photographed, video or audio recorded, please respect their wishes.</p>

        <p>Crowd shots are permitted, but when only the faces of a few people are visible, permission should be sought from all of those individuals.</p>

        <p><em>If a participant engages in behavior that violates this code of conduct, the conference organizers may take any action they deem appropriate, including warning the offender or expulsion from the conference with no refund.</em></p>
