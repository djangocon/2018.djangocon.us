Mariatta is a Python Core Developer, a software engineer at [Zapier](https://zapier.com/), [Vancouver PyLadies](https://twitter.com/pyladiesvan) co-organizer, and one of the founding members of the [PyCascades](https://2019.pycascades.com/) conference. She moved to Canada almost two decades ago, and now lives in Vancouver with her husband and two children. In her free time, she contributes to open source, builds GitHub bots, fixes typos, and likes to tell you about f-strings. She's been [credited](https://www.imdb.com/name/nm7641957/?ref_=nv_sr_1) in several movies, including __Spider Man: Homecoming__ and __The Emoji Movie__.
Her favorite emoji is :stuck_out_tongue_closed_eyes:.

Managing a large open source project like CPython is no easy task. Learn how the Python core team automated their GitHub workflow with bots, making it easier for maintainers and contributors to collaborate together. Even if you’re not managing a large project, you can still build your own bot! Hear some ideas on what you can automate on GitHub and personalize your bot based on your own workflow. All you need is Python. Don’t be a robot; build the bot.
