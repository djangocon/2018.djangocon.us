## Need some help with your proposal?

Presenters, regardless of experience, sometimes want a little help. If you’d like any help in proposing, preparing, or presenting your talk, some awesome members of our community have volunteered to be speaker mentors. A mentor is an experienced presenter who has volunteered to help other presenters. For first-time presenters, non-native English speakers, under-confident or uncertain speakers, or anyone who would just appreciate another set of eyes, our mentors will be here to help. You’ll get the best results by forming a relationship with one mentor, rather than contacting several.

## Slide Guidelines

* Use Keynote, PowerPoint, Open Office, or Google Presentations for your slides.
* Minimal slides are best—avoid walls of text and long lists of bullets.
* Aim for high contrast slides, avoiding colors that may be difficult to see for those with colorblindness. (You can [check your contrast online](http://webaim.org/resources/contrastchecker/); you just need the hex codes for your colors!)
* Light background with dark text is easiest to read; be mindful that the projector is white.
* Make text as large as possible, at least 68pt.
* Choose fonts with adequate spacing between letters, and avoid thin or cursive fonts.
* Leave the bottom ⅓ of your slides free of text to ensure nothing is obscured.
* Avoid or limit flashing videos or animated gifs, as these may have negative effects for people with seizure disorders, migraines, or ADD/ADHD.
* Images, memes, and GIFs should be appropriate for a professional audience.
* Your talk should lose nothing if the slides aren’t visible. Generally describe graphs, images, and other information for the audience.
* Consider including your Twitter handle on your opening and closing slides!
* Consider publishing your slides after your talk (on the platform of your choice) and tweeting the link with the #djangocon hashtag.
