##  Talks

Length: (20-25 minutes) or (40-45 minutes)

We are looking for original and interesting talks that can benefit the diverse interests of our audience. Don’t feel boxed into Django-centric themes; we also love talks about community, web development, user experience, and more. If you’re a first timer - don’t fret! We would love to be remembered as the conference where you started your speaking career.

Here are some examples of what has been accepted over the last couple of years:

* [DjangoCon US 2016 Talks](https://2016.djangocon.us/schedule/general-sessions/)
* [DjangoCon US 2015 Talks](https://2015.djangocon.us/schedule/general-sessions/)

##  Tutorials

Length: ~3 - 3.5 hours

We’re open to all kinds of ideas, especially ones we haven’t thought of! Technical tutorials tend to be more popular, but we welcome all topics. Tutorials can be targeted at any experience level, just be sure to indicate clearly what you expect your students to already know or have experience with{% comment %}in your proposal{% endcomment %}.
{% endcomment %}

{% comment %}Still unsure if you should submit? Not only will we cover your DjangoCon US ticket, but tutorials are compensated.{% endcomment %}

## Information for Speakers 
* The Speaker Green Room will be in Willow II on Sunday-Wednesday. Please be in the Green Room at least 10 minutes before your talk to meet your session runner, who will escort you to your presentation room.  
* The Quiet Room will be in Willow I on all conference days. 

## Need some help with your {% comment %}proposal or {% endcomment %}talk?

Presenters, regardless of experience, sometimes want a little help. If you’d like any help in {% comment %}proposing, {% endcomment %}preparing, or presenting your talk, some awesome members of our community have volunteered to be speaker mentors. A mentor is an experienced presenter who has volunteered to help other presenters. For first-time presenters, non-native English speakers, under-confident or uncertain speakers, or anyone who would just appreciate another set of eyes, our mentors will be here to help. You’ll get the best results by forming a relationship with one mentor, rather than contacting several.

## Slide Guidelines

* Use Keynote, PowerPoint, Open Office, or Google Presentations for your slides.
* Minimal slides are best—avoid walls of text and long lists of bullets.
* Aim for high contrast slides, avoiding colors that may be difficult to see for those with colorblindness. (You can [check your contrast online](http://webaim.org/resources/contrastchecker/); you just need the hex codes for your colors!)
* Light background with dark text is easiest to read; be mindful that the projector is white.
* Make text as large as possible, at least 68pt.
* Choose fonts with adequate spacing between letters, and avoid thin or cursive fonts.
* Leave the bottom ⅓ of your slides free of text to ensure nothing is obscured.
* Avoid or limit flashing videos or animated gifs, as these may have negative effects for people with seizure disorders, migraines, or ADD/ADHD.
* Images, memes, and GIFs should be appropriate for a professional audience.
* Your talk should lose nothing if the slides aren’t visible. Generally describe graphs, images, and other information for the audience.
* Consider including your Twitter handle on your opening and closing slides!
* Consider publishing your slides after your talk (on the platform of your choice) and tweeting the link with the #djangocon hashtag.
