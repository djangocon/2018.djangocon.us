# Call for Proposals is Open!

The [Call for Proposals](https://2016.djangocon.us/speaking/) is now open, and
closes on April 18, 2016.

We've got a great team of speaker mentors to help you with your talk or
tutorial proposal, and we're particularly keen on hearing from first-time
speakers and speakers from underrepresented groups. [Apply
now!](https://2016.djangocon.us/speaking/)

As with past years, there will be a travel grants program to assist people
with financial need. To apply for financial aid, please visit the [financial
aid page](https://2016.djangocon.us/financialaid/) and fill out your
application by April 25!

If you're interested in becoming a sponsor, [please get in
touch](https://2016.djangocon.us/cdn-cgi/l/email-
protection#d6a5a6b9b8a5b9a4a596b2bcb7b8b1b9b5b9b8f8a3a5).

Start working on those proposals, and we hope we'll see you at DjangoCon US!
