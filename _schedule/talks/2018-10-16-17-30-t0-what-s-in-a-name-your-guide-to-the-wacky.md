abstract: You can make a great Django app, but how will anyone know unless it's connected
  to a domain? We use Domain Name Systems (DNS) every day to access our favorite websites,
  but most people aren't even aware of it! This talk will help new developers launch
  their first website without breaking the web.

- bio: 'I''m a former Quality Assurance Analyst who got tired of waiting for developers
    to fix my bugs so I decided to fix them myself. After running away to the Pacific
    Northwest to pair program with an awesome group of women for six months, I came
    back to my hometown, Kansas City, to start my first job as a web developer on
    a Django website platform. Nearly three years and over 200 website launches later,
    I occasionally feel like I''m starting to get the hang of this whole programming
    thing. When I''m not living the startup life, I help organize Django Girls KC,
    a coding workshop for women to learn how to build a blog using Django. My role
    as attendee coordinator allows me to spread the word about Django Girls throughout
    KC and ensure that attendees have a wonderful experience during the workshop. '

So, you built a Django application. That’s great! Now, how do you get the app connected to your fancy domain name for the world to see? During this talk, you’ll learn about the phone book of the internet, otherwise known as the Domain Name Systems (DNS). We’ll go over topics such as: why DNS was created, how it works, and why it’s important for developers have a good understanding of DNS.

As a web developer who has launched hundreds of websites, I’ll tell you stories of some of my own DNS disasters and odd quirks that I’ve ran into over the last 5 years. If you’ve ever wondered why you can see your newly launched website but your coworker can’t, or if you’re ready to launch your first client website, but not take down their email in the process, you won’t want to miss this talk.
