title: "Announcing Our Talk Lineup!"
---

The Django community and beyond submitted a record number of incredible talk proposals, and selecting these talks was extremely difficult. We were only able to accept 16% of the submissions we received, and appreciate the effort everyone put into their submissions; thank you! Another huge thank-you to our reviewers, without whom this list would still be weeks in the making.
