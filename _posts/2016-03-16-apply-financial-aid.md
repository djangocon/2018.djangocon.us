# Apply for financial aid!

As part of our commitment to diversity, we are thrilled to announce that we
will be supporting individuals who need financial assistance to attend
DjangoCon US.

DEFNA ([Django Events Foundation North America](http://www.defna.org/)), the
[Django Software Foundation](https://www.djangoproject.com/foundation/), and
the [Python Software Foundation](https://www.python.org/psf/) have donated to
help meet the cost of tickets, travel, and accommodation for attendees who
need financial support. If you are a member of an underrepresented group who
will not be able to attend DjangoCon US without financial help, we strongly
encourage you to apply for financial aid.

In addition, this year, speakers will be provided with free conference tickets
to speakers to encourage wider participation from the Django community.

You can apply for financial aid by filling out [the
application](http://goo.gl/forms/XvYBg4d8o7). You'll need to provide your
name, the amount you're requesting, and some information about why you're
requesting funding. Applications need to be submitted by April 25th in order
to be considered.

The DjangoCon US 2016 planning committee will review financial aid
applications and notify those who have been accepted by May 6, 2016. Because
our budget is limited, preference will be given to potential speakers and
tutorial leaders, especially first-time speakers, and members of
underrepresented groups.

Your organization can help increase diversity at DjangoCon US by contributing
to the Financial Aid fund. Please check out our [Sponsorship
Chair](https://2016.djangocon.us/cdn-cgi/l/email-
protection#d8aba8b7b6abb7aaab98bcb2b9b6bfb7bbb7b6f6adab) for more information.

Alternatively when purchasing your ticket, you can either purchase an extra
ticket for an attendee who couldn't otherwise afford it, or you can add a
dollar amount of your choosing.
